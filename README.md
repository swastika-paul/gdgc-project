# GDGC-project
This is a basic Login/Signup/Forgot Password system built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It demonstrates how a simple authentication flow works on the front end.
# features
Users can navigate between login, signup, and forgot password pages.

Responsive layout for better viewing on different screen sizes.

Clear and simple UI design with consistent styling.
# known issues
This is a frontend-only project — no backend/database is connected.

Data entered is not saved or verified, as there’s no real authentication logic yet.
# how its work
HTML is used to structure the pages (login, signup, forgot password).

CSS is used for styling and layout.

JavaScript handles basic interactivity.

I’ve tried to give my best in this project. It helped me apply what I’ve learned in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While it’s still a work in progress, I’ve tested each part and ensured the main flow works. I look forward to improving it further as I continue learning.
